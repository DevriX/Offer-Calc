				<h2 class='content-title'>Using the plugin</h2>
			
				<h3>Howdy!</h3>

				<p>
				Our <strong>OfferCalc engine </strong> will help you to form a unique dynamic
				experience for each of your potential customers. You can list all
				of your components in a simple form, so that every user could
				calculate the cost for their custom project.
				</p>

				<div class="box">
					<p>First off, you will need to create your form. Navigate to the "<strong>Add Offer</strong>" page: </p>
					<img src="<?php echo plugins_url( 'img', __FILE__ ); ?>/add-new-offer.png" alt="add new offer" />
				</div>
				

				<div class="box">
					<p>Type in your title, and list down all of your services. Each
					service is identified by title and a cost per item. You can add an
					unlimited number of fields for your form.</p>
					<img src="<?php echo plugins_url( 'img', __FILE__ ); ?>/add-new-service.png" alt="add new service" />
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<p>So far, so good! Now, let's add the following form to a page:</p>
					<img src="<?php echo plugins_url( 'img', __FILE__ ); ?>/offer-calc-in-page.png" alt="offer calc in page" />
				</div>
			
				<p>That's right - our <em>[ofc_shortcode offer_slug="your-offer-slug-here"]</em> shortcode would embed your form accordingly. 
				You can place it on the top of the page, or you could style it through the HTML editor, 
				or wrap some text around it, it's up to you.</p>
			
				<div class="box">
					<p>The unique code for your form is available in the <strong>All Offer Calc</strong> listing:</p>
					<img src="<?php echo plugins_url( 'img', __FILE__ ); ?>/all-offer-calc-shortcodes.png" alt="all offer calc shortcodes" />
				</div>
				
				<div class="box">
					<p>or in <strong>Single Offer</strong> view:</p>
					<img src="<?php echo plugins_url( 'img', __FILE__ ); ?>/single-offer-calc-shortcodes.png" alt="single offer calc shortcodes" />
				</div>
				

				<p>Did we mention that you could add several forms to your site as well? Yes, you could! You could create a bunch of pages 
				with different forms, different services and costs. Whether it's related to different products or services, or you want 
				a hidden page with discounted prices - it's up to you, it's all possible here!</p>
			
				<div class="box">
					<p>Additionally, you could place your form in the sidebar from the widget section, just navigate to 
					<strong>Appearance</strong> -> <strong>Widgets</strong> and drag your <strong>Offer Calc Widget</strong> to the desired widget area.</p>
					<img src="<?php echo plugins_url( 'img', __FILE__ ); ?>/offer-calc-widgets.png" alt="offer calc widgets" />
				</div>

				<p>And that's a sample page with a form on a random page.</p>
		
				<p>
